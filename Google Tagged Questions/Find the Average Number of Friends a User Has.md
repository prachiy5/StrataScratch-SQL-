> Calculate the **average number of friends** per user.

### Table Schema: `google_friends_network`

| Column    | Type   |
|-----------|--------|
| user_id   | bigint |
| friend_id | bigint |

### My Thought Process

1. Friendships are bidirectional, but the table might only store one direction (e.g., Aâ†’B).
2. Use a `UNION ALL` to ensure both directions are included.
3. Count the number of friends each user has.
4. Take the average of those friend counts.

### SQL Solution

```sql
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT * FROM google_friends_network
    UNION ALL
    SELECT friend_id, user_id FROM google_friends_network
),

cte2 AS (
    SELECT user_id, COUNT(friend_id) AS total_friends
    FROM cte
    GROUP BY user_id
)

SELECT 1.0 * SUM(total_friends) / COUNT(total_friends) AS avg_friends
FROM cte2;
```

### What I Learned

This query is a great example of using symmetric relationships and aggregate functions to get meaningful network-level insights.
