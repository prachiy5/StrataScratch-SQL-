### My Thought Process

1. First, group reviews by `hotel_name` and calculate the **average** of the `average_score`.
2. Use a window function `RANK()` to sort hotels by average score.
3. Pick the **top 10** using a filter on the rank.

### SQL Solution

```sql
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT hotel_name, AVG(average_score) AS average_score
    FROM hotel_reviews 
    GROUP BY hotel_name
),

cte2 AS (
    SELECT *,
           RANK() OVER (ORDER BY average_score DESC) AS rn 
    FROM cte
)

SELECT hotel_name, average_score
FROM cte2
WHERE rn <= 10;
```
