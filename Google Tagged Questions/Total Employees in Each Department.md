### Table Schema: `worker`

| Column        | Type      |
|---------------|-----------|
| department    | varchar   |
| first_name    | varchar   |
| last_name     | varchar   |
| joining_date  | datetime2 |
| salary        | bigint    |
| worker_id     | bigint    |

### My Thought Process

1. Count each unique `worker_id` grouped by the `department` column.
2. Use `GROUP BY` and `COUNT()` to compute the result.

### SQL Solution

```sql
SELECT department, COUNT(worker_id) AS total_employees
FROM worker
GROUP BY department;
```

### What I Learned

This is a basic SQL aggregation task â€” useful for HR analytics and departmental staffing summaries.
