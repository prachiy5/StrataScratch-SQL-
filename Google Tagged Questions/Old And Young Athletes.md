### Problem Summary

Weâ€™re given a table called `olympics_athletes_events` with information about Olympic athletes.
Each row includes:
- athlete name
- age
- the Olympic games they competed in

We are asked to:
> For each Olympic games, calculate:
> 1. Number of **old athletes** (age 50 or older)
> 2. Number of **young athletes** (age 25 or younger)
> 3. The **ratio of old to young athletes**

### My Thought Process

1. First, group the data by both `games` and `name` to avoid counting the same athlete multiple times.
2. For each record, mark if the athlete is old (>= 50) or young (<= 25).
3. Then sum the total old and young athletes per Olympic game.
4. Finally, calculate the ratio of old to young athletes for each game.

### SQL Solution

```sql
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT games, 
           CASE WHEN age <= 25 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS total_young, 
           CASE WHEN age >= 50 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS total_old
    FROM olympics_athletes_events 
    GROUP BY games, name
)

SELECT games,
       SUM(total_old) AS old_athletes,
       SUM(total_young) AS young_athletes,
       SUM(total_old) * 1.0 / NULLIF(SUM(total_young), 0) AS old_to_young_ratio
FROM cte
GROUP BY games;
```

### What I Learned

This query demonstrates how to use conditional logic with `CASE`, apply grouping to avoid duplicates, and safely calculate ratios using `NULLIF` to prevent division by zero.
